# Blackjack
Simple version of Blackjack for education and fun.

This project is suitable for students that know lists, loops, branching and classes.

I split the project into 8 Sessions as outlined below.

I am not a Blackjack expert; hence, some adjustments will be needed!

## Introduction

## Session 6: build display class to show the game in terminal

## Session 7: asking for another card; first add deck attribute to Game class as we need to work with the same deck in the next round

## Session 8: adding the bank and determining winners; add bank as another player in display.py; the bank needs their own optimal response

Finally, I freeze the application using pyinstaller -c -F main.py, where the -F flag is to bundle everything into one exe file; 
open a console and keep it open using the -c flag; use cmd in folder and execute main.exe directly to keep terminal open.
